# Internship / Research Presentation Schedule

All CS1950 and CS1900 students (and BIOSC students who did an internship) must sign up for a date to give a 5-minute presentation on what they worked on.  If a choice is not made by 12 SEP (Monday), I will add you to a date myself.

Note that there is a limit on how many people can give a presentation on the same day.  This list is first-come, first-serve.  I reserve the right to move your preferred assignment of date, but will try to work this out with you beforehand to find a suitable date.

You may sign up for an OTHER date only with my permission.  Please mark your name under the Other heading and email me why you need to give your presentation on an alternate day.
